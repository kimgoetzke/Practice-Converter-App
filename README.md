# Simple Converter
This repo contains a basic unit converter app which I created to practice bash commands. 

In this project, I have practiced:

+ Creating functions
+ Reading from and writing to files
+ Basic regex for input validation
+ Loops and case statements
+ Using grep/cat/shift/seq (but didn't make it into the app)

### How to use it
The app will create a definitions.txt in the same folder on launch (unless it exists).

The user can enter (and delete definitions) and use them to convert units.

Units must be entered in the format: `[x]_to_[y]`, for example `miles_to_km 1.6`.
